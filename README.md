Hello! I'm Khanh Nguyen, a Data Science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. Right now I am working as a **Data Collections Engineer Intern** at an AI robotics startup, turning messy real world sensor data into something models can actually learn from. At the same time, I’m enrolled in Berkeley’s **Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS)** program, continuing to sharpen my storytelling capabilities.

# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio is a curated collection of my **Data Science / Machine Learning / Deep Learning** projects — from lightweight Python notebooks that demonstrate core concepts to fully **end-to-end demos** with data cleaning, modeling and evaluation, and deployment 🚀.

## Regression

### When $100k Could Buy a Home: California Housing Price Prediction 

[Github](https://github.com/khanhqn1/californiahousepricing) | [Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/khanhqn1/californiahousepricing/blob/main/Linear_Regression_ML.ipynb)

This project is an end to end build of a linear regression model, focused on the full data science workflow. I set up a clean pipeline train, a baseline model to evaluate performance, clear metrics, and use residual plots to understand where the model performs well and where it does not. The goal is less about getting the best score and more about strengthening the data science workflow, including packaging the final model for deployment.
