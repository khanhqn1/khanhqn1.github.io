Hello! I'm Khanh Nguyen, graduated from the University of California, Berkeley majoring in Data Science. Right now I am working as a **Data Collections Engineer Intern** at an AI robotics start up, turning messy real-world sensor data into something models can actually learn from. At the same time, I’m enrolled in Berkeley’s **Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS)** program, continuing to sharpen my story telling capabilities.

# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio is a curated collection of my **Data Science / Machine Learning / Deep Learning** projects — from lightweight Python notebooks that demonstrate core concepts to fully **end-to-end demos** with data cleaning, modeling and evaluation, and deployment 🚀.

## Regression

### When $100k Could Buy a Home: California Housing Price Prediction

[Github](https://github.com/khanhqn1/californiahousepricing)

This project is an end to end build of a linear regression model focused on the full data science workflow. I set up a clean pipeline train, a baseline model evaluate performance with clear metrics, and use residual plots to understand where the model performs well and where it does not. The goal is less about getting the best score and more about strengthening the data science workflow, including packaging the final model for deployment.
