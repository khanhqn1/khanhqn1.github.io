Hello! I'm Khanh Nguyen, a Data Science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. Right now I am working as a **Data Collections Engineer Intern** at an AI robotics startup, turning messy real world sensor data into something models can actually learn from. At the same time, I’m enrolled in Berkeley’s **Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS)** program, continuing to sharpen my storytelling capabilities.

# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio is a curated collection of my **Data Science / Machine Learning / Deep Learning** projects — from lightweight Python notebooks that demonstrate core concepts to fully **end-to-end demos** with data cleaning, modeling, and deployment 🚀.

## Regression

### When $100k Could Buy a Home: California Housing Price Prediction 

[Github](https://github.com/khanhqn1/californiahousepricing) | [View Notebook](https://khanhqn1.github.io/californiahousepricing/)

This project is an end to end build of a linear regression model, focused on the full data science workflow. I set up a clean pipeline train, a baseline model to evaluate performance, clear metrics, and use residual plots to understand where the model performs well and where it does not. The goal is less about getting the best score and more about strengthening the data science workflow, including packaging the final model for deployment.

## Classification

#### 🚧 Under Construction 🚧
New projects are on the way — I’m polishing this section and will be back soon! ✨👷‍♂️

## Neural Networks

### Churn Modeling ANN

[Github](https://github.com/khanhqn1/churnmodelingann) | [View Notebook](https://khanhqn1.github.io/churnmodelingann/)

This is a simple example of a feedfoward Neural Network in TensorFlow to predict customer churn from tabular customer data. It covers the full workflow including preprocessing and encoding features scaling inputs training with early stopping and evaluating results with learning curves and a confusion matrix. The focus is on practicing a clean deep learning pipeline. The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling/data).

## Natural Language Processing

####  👷‍♀️✨ Building This Section
I’m actively adding projects + write-ups here.  
In the meantime, feel free to explore the other sections! 😊🔧

## Clustering

#### 🚀 Coming Soon!
Still cooking… 🍳🔥  
This section will be filled with projects shortly 😄📈
